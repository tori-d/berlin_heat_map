# berlin_heat_map

Here is the code I used to create heat maps of my Google location history for Berlin.

Though I specifically work with Berlin, you could easily grab a different location via the get_map function.

Here are some resources I used and found helpful in making these maps:

You can download your Google Location History here - note that you need to have location history turned on to have data be generated:
